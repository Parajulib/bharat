				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
				ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
				and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
				only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
				remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
				with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
				and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
				PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br /> Contrary to
				popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
				in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
				2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
				Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
				obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
				going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
				discovered the undoubtable source.
